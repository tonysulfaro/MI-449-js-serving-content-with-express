    <p><strong>What I like About it:</strong></p>
    <p>The animation itself is top-notch.</p>
    <p><strong>Things that could be Improved</strong></p>
    <p>he storyline itself is a bit much to follow and they introduce too many
      characters for a pilot episode but I found it humerous and ejoyable nonetheless</p>
