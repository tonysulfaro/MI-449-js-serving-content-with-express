    <h2>Rick and Morty</h2>
    <p><strong>What I like About it:</strong></p>
    <p>The animation itself is top-notch. Each episode as well is stand alone for the mostpart.</p>
    <p><strong>Things that could be Improved</strong></p>
    <p>They need to release episodes more often so I can watch them.</p>
